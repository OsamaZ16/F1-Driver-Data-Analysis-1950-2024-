# F1-Driver-Data-Analysis-1950-2024-
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Formula 1 race data from 1950 to 2023. It integrates multiple datasets—including drivers, race results, driver standings, and constructors—to derive meaningful insights into driver performance, consistency, and the impact of age on winning races.

## Key analyses include:

### Driver Performance & Consistency: 
Evaluated top winners and podium finishers, and identified drivers who consistently finish in the top 5.

### Age-Based Analysis: 
Examined how driver age correlates with race wins, highlighting trends in average winning age and age distribution.

### Data Integration & Visualization:
Utilized Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) to merge, clean, and visualize data, enabling clear, data-driven insights.

This repository is designed for data analysts and motorsport enthusiasts seeking to understand historical performance trends in Formula 1 through rigorous data analysis and visualization.
