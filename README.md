# F1-Driver-Data-Analysis-1950-2024-
This analysis is built on multiple interconnected datasets, including drivers, races, race results, driver standings, and constructors. The drivers dataset contains biographical details, while the races dataset provides information about each race’s location and date. The race results dataset includes key performance metrics such as finishing positions, lap times, and points earned. The driver standings dataset tracks historical championship rankings, and the constructors dataset gives insights into the teams that participated in F1. By merging and analyzing these datasets, this project uncovers meaningful patterns in F1 history.

## Key analyses include

The driver performance analysis identifies the most successful F1 drivers by evaluating total race wins and podium finishes. This helps track the dominance of different drivers across different eras. The consistency analysis examines drivers who frequently finish in the top 5 positions, calculating their consistency percentage relative to total races. This reveals which drivers have been the most reliable over time. Lastly, the age-based analysis of race winners investigates the age distribution of drivers at the time of their victories, uncovering whether younger or older drivers have had a competitive edge in Formula 1 history.

## Technologies Used
This project is developed using Python and makes use of multiple libraries including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for data processing and visualization. Google Colab is used for interactive data analysis, while GitHub is utilized for version control and project documentation.

## Data Source
All datasets used in this analysis were obtained from Kaggle’s Formula 1 dataset, which compiles official F1 race statistics. These datasets provide a reliable foundation for exploring historical performance trends in the sport.

## Usage
This project is a valuable resource for data science enthusiasts interested in real-world sports data analysis, motorsport fans looking for data-driven insights into F1 history, and researchers studying long-term performance trends in competitive racing.
